Subject: Urgent – Regulatory Sign-Off Blocked – Admin Access to Homologation Application

Dear HSE Support Team,

We are currently blocked in progressing with a regulatory sign-off due to access issues in the Homologation application.
Our designated admin user is on long leave, and we are unable to proceed without appropriate access rights.

Could you please confirm if there is another user with admin access, or advise us on how we can resolve this as soon as possible?

Thank you in advance for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Company]

Souhaitez-vous ajouter un degré d'urgence plus marqué (ex. : deadline proche), ou est-ce suffisant ?
