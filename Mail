Subject: Request for Route Opening to External Client Server (FTP - Homologation & Production)

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am reaching out to request your assistance in opening a route to the external client server via FTP for both the homologation and production environments. I have reviewed the platform but have been unable to locate the appropriate request type for this specific need.

Here are the details:

FTP Server (Homologation): [Insert FTP Server for Homologation]

Port (Homologation): [Insert Port for Homologation]

FTP Server (Production): [Insert FTP Server for Production]

Port (Production): [Insert Port for Production]


Could you kindly guide me through the process or initiate the necessary steps to grant access? Please let me know if you require any additional information from my side.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Contact Information]

Make sure to replace the placeholders with the correct FTP server and port details for both environments.
